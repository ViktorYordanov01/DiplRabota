        <p id="intro-1">With the rapid development of electronic technology and its application fields, the types of components used are increasing day by day, and it is becoming increasingly important for engineers and technicians to learn and master the performance, use, and quality judgment methods of commonly used components.</p>
        <p id="intro-2"> Electronic components are the building blocks of any electronic circuit, and they perform a wide range of functions, from storing and filtering energy to controlling the flow of current. Some of the most commonly used electronic components include capacitors, resistors, inductors, potentiometers, diodes, transistors, tubes, relays, transformers, connectors, sensitive components, resonators, filters, and switches. Each of these components has unique features and characteristics that make them suitable for specific applications, and understanding their properties and functions is essential for designing and building reliable electronic systems.</p>

        <h2>Resistors</h2>
           <div id="blockquote"><p>A passive electrical component with two terminals that are used for either limiting or regulating the flow of electric current in electrical circuits.</p></div>
        <p>The main purpose of resistor is to reduce the current flow and to lower the voltage in any particular portion of the circuit. It is made of copper wires which are coiled around a ceramic rod and the outer part of the resistor is coated with an insulating paint.
           <br> The SI unit of resistor is Ohm.
        </p>
        <h3>Types Of Resistors</h3>
        <p>Resistors are available in different shapes and sizes. Common types that are available are through-hole and surface mount. A resistor might be static, standard resistor, special, or a pack of variable resistors.</p>
        <img src="/icons/electronic-components/types-resistors.png">
        <p>There are two types of resistors as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Linear</li>
            <li value="2">Non-linear</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="linear-rsistors">
        <h4>Linear Resistors</h4>
        <p>The resistors whose values change with change in applied temperature and voltage are known as linear resistors. There are two types of linear resistors:</p>
        <p><strong>Fixed resistors: </strong>These resistors have a specific value and these values cannot be changed. Following are the different types of fixed resistors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Carbon composition resistors</li>
            <li>Wire wound resistors</li>
            <li>Thin film resistors</li>
            <li>Thick film resistors</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Variable resistors:</strong>These resistors do not have a specific value and the values can be changed with the help of dial, knob, and screw. These resistors find applications in radio receivers for controlling volume and tone. Following are the different types of variable resistors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Potentiometers</li>
            <li>Rheostats</li>
            <li>Trimmers</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="non-linear-resistors">
        <h4>Non-Linear Resistors</h4>
        <p>The resistor values change according to the temperature and voltage applied and is not dependent on Ohm’s law. Following are the different types of non-linear resistors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thermisters</li>
            <li>Varisters</li>

        <h2>Capacitors</h2>
        <div id="blockquote"><p>Capacitors are one of the three basic electronic components, along with resistors and inductors, that form the foundation of an electrical circuit. In a circuit, a capacitor acts as a charge storage device. It stores electric charge when voltage is applied across it and releases the charge back into the circuit when needed.</p></div>
        <p>A basic capacitor is made of two parallel metal plates separated by a dielectric material.</p>
        <p>When we connect a voltage source across the capacitor, the conductor (capacitor plate) attached to the positive terminal of the source becomes positively charged, and the conductor (capacitor plate) connected to the negative terminal of the source becomes negatively charged.</p>
        <p>The dielectric between the plates prevents charges from directly moving from one plate to the other.</p>
        <img src="/icons/electronic-components/capacitor-figure.png" style="width: 400px; height: 175px;">
        <p>This creates a difference in charge levels between the two plates, leading to an electric potential difference across them.</p>
        <p>The charge accumulation in the capacitor plates is not instantaneous rather it is gradually changing.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Crystal diode</h2>
        <div id="blockquote">A diode is a semiconductor device through which current supplies in one direction only. The initial diodes were crystal diodes which are used as rectifiers in radio kits. In this diode, a weak signal was fed into the crystal material using a very fine wire namely the cat’s whisker.</div>
        <p>A crystal diode is also called a Cat’s whisker because it is a type of point-contact diode. This diode operation mainly depends on the contact’s force among the point & semiconductor crystal. This diode includes a metal wire that is pressed next to the semiconductor crystal. Here, the crystal acts works like a cathode & metal wire acts as an anode. These types of diodes are outdated within nature and used in detectors, microwave receivers, and rectifiers. The crystal diode symbol is shown below.</p>
        <img src="/icons/electronic-components/crystal-diode-schema.png" style="width: 450px; height: 180px;">
        <div id="diode-construction">
            <h3>Crystal Diode Construction</h3>
            <p>A crystal diode is designed with two dissimilar kinds of semiconductor materials beside the other. In this diode, one side is simple to flow the electrons whereas another side is not easy. But electrons try to jump from one side to the other across the border to form a current and nothing will take place. The alternating current which comes from outside can change by the diode to the direct current that most appliances require.</p>
            <img src="/icons/electronic-components/diode-construction.png">
            <p>Generally, these diodes are also called point contact diodes which are the old type microwave semiconductor devices. These were mainly designed for utilizing in microwave receivers & at present, they are still used like detectors & receiver mixers. As compared to PN junction diode, crystal diodes mainly depend on the contact force among a semiconductor crystal & the point for its action.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Zener diode</h2>
        <div id="blockquote">A heavily doped semiconductor diode which is designed to operate in reverse direction is known as the Zener diode. In other words, the diode which is specially designed for optimising the breakdown region is known as the Zener diode.</div>
        <p>The symbolic representation of Zener diode is shown in the figure below.</p>
        <img src="/icons/electronic-components/zener-diode-symbol.png" style="width: 350px; height: 150px;">
        <div id="working-of-zener-diode">
            <h3>Working of Zener Diode</h3>
          <p>The Zener diode is made up of heavily doped semiconductor material. The depletion region of the Zener diode is very thin because of the impurities. The heavily doping material increases the intensity of the electric field across the depletion region of the Zener diode even for the small reverse voltage.</p>
          <p>When no biasing is applied across the Zener diode, the electrons remains in the valence band of the p-type material and no current flow through the diode. The band in which the valence electrons (outermost orbit electron) place is known as the valence band electron. The electrons of the valence band easily move from one band to another when the external energy is applied across it.</p>
          <img src="/icons/electronic-components/zener-1.png" style="width: 300px; height: 150px;">
          <p>When the reverse bias applies across the diode and the supply voltage is equal to the Zener voltage then it starts conducting in the reverse bias direction. The Zener voltage is the voltage at which the depletion region completely vanish.</p>
          <img src="/icons/electronic-components/zener-2.png" style="width: 300px; height: 150px;">
          <p>The reverse bias applies across the diode increases the intensity of electric field across the depletion region. Thus, it allows the electrons to move from the valence band of P-type material to the conduction band of N-type material. This transferring of valence band electrons to the conduction band reduces the barrier between the p and n-type material. When the depletion region become completely vanish the diode starts conducting in the reverse biased.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Inductor</h2>
        <div id="blockquote">An inductor (also known as an electrical inductor) is defined as a two-terminal passive electrical element that stores energy in the form of a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. It is also called a coil, chokes, or reactor.</div>
        <p>An inductor is simply a coil of wire. It usually consists of a coil of conducting material, typically insulated copper, wrapped into an iron core either of plastic or ferromagnetic material; thus, it is called an iron-core inductor.</p>
        <p>According to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, when the current through an inductor changes, the varying magnetic field creates an electromotive force (e.m.f) or voltage. This induced voltage is proportional to the rate of change of current through the inductor.</p>
        <p>Inductance (L) is a property of an inductor that opposes any change in magnitude or direction of current flowing through it. The larger an inductor’s inductance, the greater the capacity to store electrical energy in the form of the magnetic field.</p>
        <div id="how-inductors-work">
            <h3>How Inductors Work</h3>
            <p>The inductor in a circuit opposes changes in current flow through it by inducing a voltage across it which is proportional to the rate of change of current flow. To understand how the inductor work in a circuit, consider the image shown below.</p>
            <img src="/icons/electronic-components/how-ind-works.png">
            <p>As shown, a lamp, a coil of wire (inductor), and a switch are connected to a battery. If we remove the inductor from the circuit, the lamp lights up normally. With the inductor, the circuit behaves completely differently.</p>
            <p>The inductor has much lower resistance compared to the lamp. When the switch is closed, most of the current flows through the coil, providing a low-resistance path. Therefore, we expect the lamp to glow dimly.</p>
            <p>But due to inductor behavior in the circuit, when we close the switch, the lamp glows brightly and then gets dimmer and when we open the switch, the bulb glows very brightly and then quickly goes out.</p>

        <h2>Varactor diodes</h2>
        <div id="blockquote">Varactor Diode is a PN junction diode that is especially operated in reverse biased mode. It is a device whose capacitance varies with the variation in the applied reverse bias potential. It is also known as varicap or voltcap.</div>
        <p>As these are specially designed diodes thus exhibits the characteristic of transition capacitance far better as compared to normal PN junction diodes.</p>
        <div id="vdiode-symbol">
            <p>The figure below shows the symbolic representation of a varactor diode:</p>
            <img src="/icons/electronic-components/varcator-symbol.png" style="width: 300px; height: 100px;">
            <p>Its symbol is somewhat similar to an ordinary diode. However, in varactor diode, the cathode terminal is shown by the 2 plates of the capacitor. This is done to represent the effect of capacitance during operation.</p>
            </div>
         <div id="working-of-vdiode">
            <h3>Working of Varactor Diode</h3>
            <p>As we have already discussed that the varactor diode is a reverse biased device. That means the operation for which it is specified is noticed in a reverse biased condition rather than forward biased. Now, the question arises why this is so?</p>
            <p>Let us first understand why it is not operated in forward biased condition.</p>
            <p>When a diode is provided forward potential. Then the majority carriers present both in p and n region experiences repulsion from the battery. Due to this, after a certain voltage, the depletion region diminishes and the device starts conducting heavily. <i>But, a varactor diode is basically manufactured to store the charges rather than conducting current.</i> This is the reason why we provide reverse bias to the diode.</p>
            <p>The figure below represents the reverse biased arrangement of the varactor diode:</p>
            <img src="/icons/electronic-components/varcator-working.png" style="width: 300px; height: 180px;">
            <p>Initially, a thin depletion region is present in case of no bias condition. But as the reverse potential is applied the majority carriers of both the p and n regions i.e., holes and electrons start moving away from the junction. Due to this, the majority carriers depleted from the junction. So, as the reverse potential is increased, the depletion width also increases. In this case, the two regions serve as the capacitor plates and the depletion region behaves as an insulating dielectric.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Crystal triode</h2>
      <p>As is evident from the name, triode tube is composed of three electrodes (Tri means three while Ode means electrodes). One of these is called cathode (filament type or indirectly heated oxide coated type), second one anode (plate) and the third one control grid. Grid is kept between cathode and anode and it is closer to cathode as compared to anode. In other words, triode valve is similar to diode with the exception that there is a grid between cathode and anode. The construction of triode and its symbols have been presented in the figure below:</p>
      <img src="/icons/electronic-components/triode-making.png" style="width: 300px; height: 340px;">
      <p>In this tube, control grid is composed of a fine wire mesh structure or circular helix (though grid’s structure may be in other shapes as well apart from circular helix e.g. smooth, oval, spring type or stairs like). The objective of making grid as a mesh wired tube is to allow electrons pass through it freely. Due to its mesh structure, grid does not pose any direct hurdle in the way of flow of electrons moving towards anode, however it has striking influence on the electric field created between anode and cathode, when voltage is supplied to the grid, as result, the total flow of electrons gets influenced.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Field effect transistors</h2>
        <div id="blockquote">A field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the current flow through a semiconductor channel. FETs are widely used in electronic circuits due to their high input impedance, low output impedance and high gain.</div>
        <div id="how-does-fet-work">
            <p>FETs have three terminals: the source (S), the drain (D) and the gate (G). When we apply a voltage to the gate, it creates an electric field that either attracts or repels the charge carriers (electrons or holes) in the channel region. Whether the charge carriers are attracted or repelled depends on the voltage’s polarity. The process of applying a voltage to the gate of the FET controls the channel’s conductivity and the current flow between the source and drain terminals. The construction of FET has been shown in the figure below:</p>
            <img src="/icons/electronic-components/fet.png" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
        </div>
        <div id="types-of-fet">
            <h3>Types of FETs</h3>
            <h4>Junction Field-Effect Transistor (JFET)</h4>
            <p>In a JFET, the channel consists of a semiconductor material and the channel has two regions at each end. These are known as the source and the drain terminals. The gate is a PN junction that’s formed perpendicular to the channel. The gate terminal is biased in reverse. This creates a depletion region that controls the width of the channel. When we apply a voltage to the gate, the depletion region widens, thereby reducing the channel width and the current flowing through it.</p>
            <h4>Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET)</h4>
            <p>Similar to JFETs, in MOSFETs the channel is also formed by a semiconductor material and it has two regions at either end, known as the source and drain terminals. In a MOSFET however, the gate is separated from the channel by a thin insulating layer that typically consists of silicon dioxide. As soon as a voltage is applied to the gate, it creates an electric field that attracts or repels charge carriers in the channel, depending on the voltage’s polarity. This process controls the width of the channel and the flow of current between the source and drain terminals.</p>
