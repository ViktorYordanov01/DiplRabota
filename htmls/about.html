    <h1>About The Project</h1>
    <p>The periodic system of elements, developed by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, stands as one of the most profound organizational frameworks in the field of chemistry, with its impact extending far beyond its initial conception. Mendeleev’s arrangement of elements by atomic weight and chemical properties not only predicted the existence of undiscovered elements but also laid the groundwork for modern materials science, particularly in the domain of electronics.</p>
    <p>This thesis explores the pivotal role that the periodic table plays in the manufacturing of electronic components, with a focus on semiconductors. Semiconductors, primarily composed of elements like silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and gallium (Ga), are the backbone of modern electronics. The unique properties of these elements, governed by their positions on the periodic table, make them ideal for controlling electrical currents in devices ranging from simple diodes to complex microprocessors.</p>
    <p>The process of photolithography, a cornerstone in semiconductor fabrication, is examined in detail. This technique, which involves the selective removal or modification of material using light, relies heavily on the chemical behavior of elements as predicted by the periodic table. The careful selection of photoresists and antireflective coatings, which are based on specific elements and compounds, is crucial to achieving the precision required in microprocessor production.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the thesis delves into the evolution of microprocessors, tracing how advances in understanding the periodic table have enabled the miniaturization and increased efficiency of these critical components. By manipulating elements at the atomic level, manufacturers have been able to produce microprocessors with billions of transistors, driving the rapid advancement of computing technology.</p>
    <p>Through a comprehensive analysis, this thesis highlights the enduring relevance of Mendeleev’s periodic system in contemporary science and technology. It underscores how the principles governing elemental behavior are not only fundamental to chemistry but are also integral to the cutting-edge processes that power the modern world.</p>
